# PAID OFF — demo prototype

This is a **UX + investor** prototype of a privacy-first crypto casino concept.

- **Demo only**: no real money, no blockchain integrations
- Demo wallet stored in **localStorage**
- "Privacy Mode" is a UX toggle (hides balances)

## Run locally

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## What to show in a pitch

1) Home → story & positioning  
2) Wallet → deposit/withdraw flows + activity  
3) Games → open a game → place a bet (demo)  
4) Admin → event stream concept (audit trail placeholder)

## Next steps (if needed)

- Replace demo wallet with backend service (users, sessions, wallets)
- Integrate a game aggregator API
- Add legal/compliance flows depending on jurisdiction
